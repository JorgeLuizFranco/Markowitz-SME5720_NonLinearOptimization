# Lagrangean Quadratic Optimization - Markowitz Model

This repository contains Julia scripts for solving Lagrangean Quadratic Optimization problems.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the optimization script:

1. **Navigate to the bin directory:**
    ```bash
    cd julia-1.9.4-linux-x86_64/julia-1.9.4/bin
    ```

2. **Open the terminal in this directory.**

3. **Run the Julia interpreter:**
    ```bash
    ./julia
    ```

4. **In the Julia console, execute the following command to include the optimization script:**
    ```julia
    include("lag_qua.jl")
    ```

Feel free to customize the optimization script and explore the functionality.
